## 5. Agile Process:

a. User Stories:
- As a user, I want a visually appealing webpage with interactive features for a better user experience.

b. Sprint Planning:
- design navigation, implement background effects, add popup functionality, etc.

##FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION IN AGILE:
 Iterative Development:
- Develop the webpage incrementally, focusing on high-priority features first.
- Regularly review and test the implemented features.

e. Continuous Integration:
- Integrate code changes frequently to identify and resolve conflicts early.
- Automated testing can be incorporated to ensure code quality.

f. Sprint Review:
- At the end of each sprint, review the implemented features.
- Gather feedback and make adjustments based on user input.

g. Retrospective:
- Reflect on the sprint's successes and challenges.
- Discuss improvements and adjustments for future sprints.

h. Documentation:
- Maintain documentation for code, design decisions, and any notable features.
- Update documentation as the project evolves.

i. User Feedback:
- Collect feedback from users during and after the development process.
- Make improvements based on user suggestions.

j. Release:
- Once the webpage meets the desired criteria, release it to the production environment.

k. Maintenance:
- Monitor the webpage's performance and address any issues that arise.
- Plan for future enhancements and updates based on user feedback.

This agile approach allows for flexibility, collaboration, and the ability to respond to changes efficiently throughout the development process.
